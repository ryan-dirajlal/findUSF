# Discover Hilltop Privacy Policy
No information is collected by Discover Hilltop beyond what Apple collects. 
The app will ask to access your photos if you want to save an in-app picture, but we will not have access to your device pictures.
Although Discover Hilltop includes an interactive map, it will not use or track your location.
Discover Hilltop does not connect to the internet except to provide the map view of campus. However, clicking external links to see the University Archive and this Privacy Policy will cause your device to leave the app, open your browser, and connect to the internet.
We are also not affiliated with the University of San Francisco, nor any other organization, and all content in the app is owned by Ryan Dirajlal.
